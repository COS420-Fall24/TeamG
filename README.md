# Mission Statement

Make the world better, one program at a time!

# Problem Statement

**Problem Statement**: Financial planning requires higher level math than many adults will understand, so many turn to online tools or don’t plan. Financial literacy isn’t emphasized in our school systems.

**Example**: 46% of American households have credit card debt, an indicator of poor financial decisions. Additionally, budgeting and saving are neglected in many households.

**Prior Solution** + Issues: Many existing tools are available, but people don’t use them and they can be hard to find. Furthermore, a lot of financial sites are filled with ads or have a paywall.

**Question**: How can we design a tool that people can use as a one stop shop for financial planning?**
